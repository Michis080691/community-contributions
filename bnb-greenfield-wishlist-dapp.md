# Challenges

## Challenge: Publishing Platform on BNB Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals
1. Tokenize the content and exchange on the platform
1. Achieve the data content ownership with blockchain technology
1. Implement anti-piracy measures

### Challenge Description
We are looking for a publishing platform that can leverage the benefits of BNB Greenfield, a decentralized storage network that offers high performance, low cost, and censorship resistance. The platform should allow authors to upload their work to BNB Greenfield and automatically sync it with BNB Smart Chain, where they can sell their work using smart contracts. The platform should also provide anti-piracy measures to protect the intellectual property rights of the authors and prevent unauthorized copying or distribution of their work. The platform should be user-friendly, scalable, and secure. We are interested in proposals that can demonstrate the feasibility, functionality, and innovation of the publishing platform. 



## Challenge: Content Sharing Platform BNB Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals

1. Tokenize the content and exchange on the platform
2. Achieve the data content ownership with blockchain technology
3. Implement anti-piracy measures

### Challenge Description

We are looking for a platform for content creators and their fans to interact and monetize their work. The platform should leverage the BNB Greenfield decentralized storage network to store and stream various types of content, such as videos, podcasts, blogs, etc. The platform should also enable a pay-per-view model, where fans can support their favorite creators by paying a fee to access their exclusive content. Additionally, the platform should foster social impact by integrating a fellowship program that connects creators with mentors, peers, and resources to help them grow their skills and reach. The platform should cater to both large and small creators, and provide them with tools to manage their fan communities, analytics, and revenue streams.



## Challenge: Knowledge Sharing Platform BNB Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals

1. Explore dynamic and attracting knowledge sharing application with decentralized storage network
2. Manage permission via smart contract

### Challenge Description

We are looking for a talented and visionary developer to build a knowledge sharing platform that leverages the power of Greenfield decentralized storage network and BSC smart contract. The platform should enable users to create, share, and monetize their knowledge in various formats, such as text, audio, and video. The platform should also allow users to customize their profiles, join or create subscription-based private channels, and receive direct donations from their followers. The platform should be user-friendly, scalable, and secure, and should offer a competitive edge over existing platforms like Twitter(X) and Mirror.xyz.



## Challenge: Personal Data Marketplace BNB Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals

1. Personal data ownership and protection
2. Monetization of personal data

### Challenge Description

BNB Greenfield is looking for proposals to create a personal data marketplace on its decentralized storage network. The marketplace should allow users to store their personal data in an encrypted and secure way, and to grant or revoke access to their data to third parties, possibly for a fee. The marketplace should respect the users' ownership and privacy of their data, and provide incentives for data sharing and monetization. The proposals should address the following aspects:

- How to ensure the encryption and integrity of the personal data stored on the network
- How to design a user-friendly interface for managing data access and permissions
- How to implement a payment mechanism for data transactions
- How to handle disputes and conflicts between data owners and data consumers
- How to comply with relevant regulations and ethical standards for personal data protection



## Challenge: Blockchain of Things(BoT) BNB Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals

1. Seamless data collection and storage 
2. Enhanced security and reliability of IoT data

### Challenge Description

The objective of this proposal is to design and implement a Blockchain of Things (BoT) system that can enable seamless data collection and storage from IoT devices on the BNB Greenfield decentralized storage network. The proposed system will leverage the advantages of blockchain technology, such as immutability, transparency, and distributed consensus, to enhance the security and reliability of IoT data. 

The proposed system will provide several benefits for IoT data collection and storage, such as:

- Reduced cost and complexity of data management by eliminating the need for centralized servers or intermediaries.
- Increased security and privacy of data by using encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
- Improved scalability and performance of data transfer and storage by using a distributed network of peers.
- Enhanced trust and transparency of data by using blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and provenance.



## Challenge: Decentralized AI Training - AI Labeling on BNB Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals

1. Efficient access control
2. Large, diverse user base for labeling
3. Programmable payments via BSC

### Challenge Description

We are looking for proposals to develop a decentralized AI training platform that leverages Greenfield, a novel decentralized storage network powered by BNB. 

The platform should enable users to contribute their data and annotations for creating high-quality AI datasets, and receive rewards in BNB tokens for their efforts. The platform should also provide efficient access control mechanisms to ensure data privacy and security, as well as programmable payments via smart contracts to facilitate transactions. The platform should aim to attract a large and diverse user base for labeling various types of data, such as images, text, audio, video, etc.



## Challenge: Data Driven API and Services on BNB Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals

1. Efficient API creation
2. Data-driven services
3. Developer-friendly environment

### Challenge Description

We are looking for a solution that can help us create data-driven APIs and services for our BNB Greenfield project. The solution should be like:

- Generate APIs and services based on the data provided by developers, similar to platforms like RapidAPI.
- Enable efficient API creation with minimal coding and configuration.
- Provide data-driven services that can analyze, visualize, and optimize the data for various use cases.
- Offer a developer-friendly environment that supports multiple languages, frameworks, and tools.

The wish list item should also explain the benefits of the solution for our BNB Greenfield project, such as:

- Reducing the development time and cost of creating APIs and services.
- Enhancing the quality and performance of the APIs and services.
- Increasing the value and usability of the data for our customers and partners.
- Improving the scalability and reliability of the APIs and services.



## Challenge: Trustless Notary on BNB Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals

1. Transparent auction process
2. Slashing mechanism to discourage malicious actors
3. Compensation models for notary maintainers

### Challenge Description

We are looking for a team of developers who can create a trustless notary system based on the BNB Greenfield platform. The system should use smart contracts to enable users to verify the existence and integrity of any digital document without relying on a centralized authority. The system should also have a transparent auction process to select the best notary for each document, and a slashing mechanism to discourage malicious actors from tampering with the documents or the verification process. The system should also provide compensation models for the notary maintainers who ensure the security and availability of the system. The goal of this project is to establish social trust and reduce transaction costs in various domains that require notarization, such as legal, financial, or academic.
