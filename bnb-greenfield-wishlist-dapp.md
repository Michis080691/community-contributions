# Challenges

## Challenge: Blockchain of Things(BoT) BNB Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals

1. Seamless data collection and storage 
2. Enhanced security and reliability of IoT data

### Challenge Description

The objective of this proposal is to design and implement a Blockchain of Things (BoT) system that can enable seamless data collection and storage from IoT devices on the BNB Greenfield decentralized storage network. The proposed system will leverage the advantages of blockchain technology, such as immutability, transparency, and distributed consensus, to enhance the security and reliability of IoT data. 

The proposed system will provide several benefits for IoT data collection and storage, such as:

- Reduced cost and complexity of data management by eliminating the need for centralized servers or intermediaries.
- Increased security and privacy of data by using encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
- Improved scalability and performance of data transfer and storage by using a distributed network of peers.
- Enhanced trust and transparency of data by using blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and provenance.
