# Challenges

## Challenge: BNB Chain governance

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. Develop a comprehensive governance platform for BNB Chain.
2. Unify voting across opBNB, zkBNB, and Greenfield chains.
3. Prioritize user-friendly interface and clarity for easy participation.

### Challenge Description:
The challenge aims to address the current issue in the BNB Chain 
ecosystem, where the BNB token gets split across multiple chains, making 
it difficult for BNB token holders to conduct voting on community 
proposals. The proposed solution involves developing a comprehensive 
governance platform that brings together opBNB, zkBNB, and Greenfield, 
providing increased transparency and ease of use for BNB token holders.

The platform will visually illustrate and record the governance history of 
the past three years on BSC and enable future votes across all BNB Chain 
blockchains using BNB tokens. By doing so, it will offer a unified and 
user-friendly interface for participants to engage in decision-making 
processes within the ecosystem.

The platform will focus on showcasing the flow of decision-making, voting 
outcomes, proposal initiation, and execution. It will serve as a 
centralized hub for all governance-related activities, offering real-time 
updates on decisions and status, and empowering users to understand the 
impact of these decisions on the BSC network's evolution.

To ensure effectiveness, the governance platform must prioritize clarity 
and conciseness, providing clear and concise information for easy 
comprehension. The user experience will be emphasized, ensuring that 
participants can navigate the platform effortlessly and actively engage in 
voting and other governance activities.

By developing this comprehensive governance solution, the BNB Chain 
ecosystem aims to enhance the governance mechanisms critical to its 
function and growth. The platform will bridge the gap caused by the 
expansion of chains and enable the seamless participation of BNB token 
holders in shaping the future of the network.
## Challenge: User-friendly multi-chain wallet interface

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. Create user-friendly multi-chain wallet interface.
2. Enable easy network switching for convenience.
3. Ensure secure connections for user data protection.

### Challenge Description:
The Multi-Chain Wallet User Interface Experience challenge calls upon 
talented developers and designers to create a seamless and user-friendly 
interface for managing various BNB-related networks within a single 
platform.

The challenge addresses the current inconvenience users face while 
navigating and interacting with BNBChain's affiliated networks like BSC, 
zkBNB, BNB Beacon Chain, and BNB Greenfield. The existing process of 
manually inputting details to connect wallets and Web3 middleware 
providers to the correct Chain ID and Network ID needs improvement.

Participants are tasked with designing and implementing an innovative 
solution that simplifies the user experience and enhances security. The 
solution should enable users to effortlessly manage and switch between 
different networks of BNB Chain, reducing the need for manual inputs.

Key considerations include:

**User-Friendliness:** The solution should prioritize an intuitive user 
interface that provides a seamless experience. Users should be able to 
easily understand and navigate the platform, even if they are new to 
multi-chain wallet services.

**Easy Network Switching:** The challenge seeks a solution that allows 
users to switch between different networks with minimal effort. This 
feature should promote convenience and adaptability for users with diverse 
network needs.

**Secure Connection:** Security is of utmost importance in handling 
financial transactions. The proposed solution should ensure a secure 
connection to each network, protecting users' assets and data.

**Automated Network Management:** The solution should minimize the 
necessity for manual inputs from users when connecting to various 
networks. Automating the process will make the platform more efficient and 
reduce potential errors. Given all BNB Chain networks share the same 
address space, a possible solution may include signing messages on one 
network to propagate to another.
## Challenge: Accelerating Blockchain Node Synchronization

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. Accelerate blockchain node synchronization.
2. Reduce resources and energy consumption.
3. Prioritize data integrity and security.

### Challenge Description:
This challenge calls for innovative methods or algorithms to expedite the 
synchronization process for new nodes joining the blockchain network.

As the blockchain network expands, the time required for new nodes to 
synchronize with the latest block increases significantly. Your task is to 
design an efficient solution that reduces resource and energy consumption 
during synchronization. The proposed method should prioritize data 
integrity, ensuring secure and reliable data transfer.

To address this challenge, participants must thoroughly examine the 
current synchronization processes, identifying bottlenecks and 
limitations. The proposed solution should aim to enhance the speed of 
synchronization without compromising data integrity and security.

Considering the potential growth and scale of the BSC network, the winning 
solution will be capable of accommodating increased network traffic while 
maintaining optimal performance. The proposed method should be scalable 
and adaptable to accommodate the network's future expansion.

Participants are encouraged to think creatively and propose novel 
approaches that revolutionize the blockchain node synchronization process, 
making it more efficient, secure, and energy-friendly.
