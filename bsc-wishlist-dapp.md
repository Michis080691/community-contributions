# Challenges



## Challenge: BNB Smart Chain AI generated content platform 

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. AI generated content tokenization
2. Improve AI generated content ecosystem by on-chain governance

### Challenge Description:
We are looking for a proposal of a on chain AI generated content platform service for BNB Smart Chain. The service should allow users to create, share and monetize various types of content, such as text, images, audio and video, using advanced AI models that run on the blockchain. The service should also provide incentives for content creators, consumers and validators, as well as mechanisms for governance, quality control and dispute resolution. The service should leverage the features and benefits of the BNB Smart Chain, such as high performance, low fees, cross-chain compatibility and rich ecosystem. The service should aim to become a leading platform for AI generated content in the blockchain space, attracting users from different domains and backgrounds.



## Challenge: Real World Asset tokenization on BNB Smart Chain

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Accelerate Real World Asset tokenization.
2. Defi lego based on RWA with more liquidity

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for proposals of innovative and scalable solutions that can bring real world assets (RWA) to the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem. RWA are assets that exist outside the blockchain, such as real estate, art, commodities, etc. By tokenizing RWA and bridging them to BSC, we can unlock new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) and create more value for the BSC community.

We are interested in protocols that can:

- Provide a secure and reliable way to verify, mint, and transfer RWA tokens on BSC
- Enable 24/7 transactions of RWA tokens with low fees and high speed
- Integrate with existing DeFi protocols on BSC and offer new use cases such as lending, borrowing, staking, etc.
- Increase the liquidity and diversity of RWA tokens on BSC
- Comply with the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks for RWA



## Challenge: Advanced DeFi

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Leverage BNB Smart Chain DeFi platform and adding more values
2. Enhance on-chain metrics like high TVL, low slippage.

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for proposals of advanced DeFi projects that can leverage the BNB Smart Chain and enhance the existing ecosystem. We are interested in innovative protocols that can offer new functionalities, such as oracle-less DeFi, yield boosting, position management, liquidity provision, and more. We want to see projects that can build on top of established DeFi platforms, such as PancakeSwap, and create more value for the BSC users with different risk preferences. We also want to see projects that have good on-chain metrics, such as high TVL, low slippage, fast transactions, and low fees. 



## Challenge: Decentralized Social Network 

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Innovate on the social network with blockchain technology
2. Protect and tokenize user data and contents
3. Censorship resistance

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for a team of developers who can create a decentralized social network for the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. The network should be a crypto native platform that supports various social features such as messaging, live streaming, and content sharing. The network should also leverage the power of smart contracts, social assets, and product functions on BNB Smart Chain to enable new ways of monetization for content creators and users. The network should store its social data on Greenfield, a decentralized storage solution that ensures data sovereignty and privacy. The network should aim to eliminate the need for intermediaries and provide a better value proposition for its participants. 



## Challenge: Stable Coin Payment for BNB Smart Chain

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Easy to use stable coin payment system
2. High efficiency payment with low cost, especially for cross-board payment

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for proposals of stable coin payment solutions that leverage the BNB Smart Chain as the underlying infrastructure. The solutions should aim to provide a seamless, secure and efficient way of using stable coins for various online or offline consumption scenarios, such as e-commerce, gaming, remittance, etc. The solutions should also be easy to use and open to all users, regardless of their location, identity or financial status. The solutions should take advantage of the high performance and low cost of the BNB Smart Chain, especially for cross-border payment transactions. The solutions should demonstrate how they can integrate with existing stable coin projects/wallets or create new ones that are compatible with the BNB Smart Chain standards and protocols.



## Challenge: ZK-based Data exchange

### Main Objectives/Goals: 

1. Privacy protection for data exchange.
2. Tokenization of data and enhance data ownership

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for proposals to develop a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) based data marketplace on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) network. The goal of this project is to enable data providers and consumers to exchange data in a privacy-preserving way, without revealing sensitive information or compromising data quality. The ZKP data marketplace should support the following features:

- Data providers can register their data sets and specify the price, terms and conditions of access.
- Data consumers can browse the available data sets and request access to the ones they are interested in.
- Data providers can verify the identity and eligibility of data consumers using ZKP techniques, such as zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs.
- Data consumers can pay for the data access using BNB tokens or other supported cryptocurrencies on the BSC network.
- Data providers can deliver the data to the data consumers using secure encryption and decryption protocols, such as encryption or secret sharing.
- Data consumers can verify the authenticity and integrity of the data using ZKP techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge or zero-knowledge proofs of membership.
- Data providers and consumers can rate and review each other based on their experience and satisfaction.

We are looking for proposals that demonstrate the feasibility, scalability and security of the ZKP data marketplace, as well as the potential benefits and use cases for various industries and sectors. The proposals should include a detailed technical design, a realistic timeline and budget, and a clear evaluation plan. The proposals should also address the challenges and risks involved in implementing the ZKP data marketplace, such as regulatory compliance, interoperability, user adoption and incentive alignment.


## Challenge: Intent-based protocol

### Main Objectives/Goals: 

1. Make usersâ€™ demand to be clearly expressed and executed accurately on-chain through multiple protocols/ tools.
2. High efficiency with low user barriers to enable onboarding more users.


### Challenge Description:

We are looking for proposals of building intent-based protocol on top of BNB Smart Chain that can:
1. Utilise Account Abstraction Solution to lower done user barrier;
2. Integrate different protocols/tools like dexes, bridges,anti-mev tool on BNBChain to solve the existing issues of dapps including fragmented user experience,low efficiency and etc.
3. Involve AI solution to assist users in decision making. 
4. Better demonstrate the high performance and low cost of BNB Smart Chain
5. Can be compatible with other intent solver/protocols in the future.
This proposal should clearly state what unique values/features it can bring to BNBChain Smart Chain ecosystem and also address the potential risk like privacy issue and security issue.
