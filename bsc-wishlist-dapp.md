# Challenges


## Challenge: BNB Smart Chain AI generated content platform 

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. AI generated content tokenization
2. Improve AI generated content ecosystem by on-chain governance

### Challenge Description:
We are looking for a proposal of a on chain AI generated content platform service for BNB Smart Chain. The service should allow users to create, share and monetize various types of content, such as text, images, audio and video, using advanced AI models that run on the blockchain. The service should also provide incentives for content creators, consumers and validators, as well as mechanisms for governance, quality control and dispute resolution. The service should leverage the features and benefits of the BNB Smart Chain, such as high performance, low fees, cross-chain compatibility and rich ecosystem. The service should aim to become a leading platform for AI generated content in the blockchain space, attracting users from different domains and backgrounds.



## Challenge: Real World Asset tokenization on BNB Smart Chain

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Accelerate Real World Asset tokenization.
2. Defi lego based on RWA with more liquidity

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for proposals of innovative and scalable solutions that can bring real world assets (RWA) to the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem. RWA are assets that exist outside the blockchain, such as real estate, art, commodities, etc. By tokenizing RWA and bridging them to BSC, we can unlock new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) and create more value for the BSC community.

We are interested in protocols that can:

- Provide a secure and reliable way to verify, mint, and transfer RWA tokens on BSC
- Enable 24/7 transactions of RWA tokens with low fees and high speed
- Integrate with existing DeFi protocols on BSC and offer new use cases such as lending, borrowing, staking, etc.
- Increase the liquidity and diversity of RWA tokens on BSC
- Comply with the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks for RWA



## Challenge: Advanced DeFi

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Leverage BNB Smart Chain DeFi platform and adding more values
2. Enhance on-chain metrics like high TVL, low slippage.

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for proposals of advanced DeFi projects that can leverage the BNB Smart Chain and enhance the existing ecosystem. We are interested in innovative protocols that can offer new functionalities, such as oracle-less DeFi, yield boosting, position management, liquidity provision, and more. We want to see projects that can build on top of established DeFi platforms, such as PancakeSwap, and create more value for the BSC users with different risk preferences. We also want to see projects that have good on-chain metrics, such as high TVL, low slippage, fast transactions, and low fees. 



## Challenge: Decentralized Social Network 

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Innovate on the social network with blockchain technology
2. Protect and tokenize user data and contents
3. Censorship resistance

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for a team of developers who can create a decentralized social network for the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. The network should be a crypto native platform that supports various social features such as messaging, live streaming, and content sharing. The network should also leverage the power of smart contracts, social assets, and product functions on BNB Smart Chain to enable new ways of monetization for content creators and users. The network should store its social data on Greenfield, a decentralized storage solution that ensures data sovereignty and privacy. The network should aim to eliminate the need for intermediaries and provide a better value proposition for its participants.
