# Challenges

## Challenge: ZK-based Data exchange

### Main Objectives/Goals: 

1. Privacy protection for data exchange.
2. Tokenization of data and enhance data ownership

### Priority 

High, Medium, Low

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for proposals to develop a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) based data marketplace on the opBNB network. The goal of this project is to enable data providers and consumers to exchange data in a privacy-preserving way, without revealing sensitive information or compromising data quality. The ZKP data marketplace should support the following features:

- Data providers can register their data sets and specify the price, terms and conditions of access.
- Data consumers can browse the available data sets and request access to the ones they are interested in.
- Data providers can verify the identity and eligibility of data consumers using ZKP techniques, such as zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs.
- Data consumers can pay for the data access using BNB tokens or other supported cryptocurrencies on the opBNB network.
- Data providers can deliver the data to the data consumers using secure encryption and decryption protocols, such as encryption or secret sharing.
- Data consumers can verify the authenticity and integrity of the data using ZKP techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge or zero-knowledge proofs of membership.
- Data providers and consumers can rate and review each other based on their experience and satisfaction.

We are looking for proposals that demonstrate the feasibility, scalability and security of the ZKP data marketplace, as well as the potential benefits and use cases for various industries and sectors. The proposals should include a detailed technical design, a realistic timeline and budget, and a clear evaluation plan. The proposals should also address the challenges and risks involved in implementing the ZKP data marketplace, such as regulatory compliance, interoperability, user adoption and incentive alignment.



## Challenge: opBNB On-chain Identity

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Improve the ecosystem of identity service on the opBNB chain.
2. Promote the innovative applications based on the identity service.

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for a proposal of a on-chain identity service for opBNB that can provide a secure, decentralized and user-friendly way of managing digital identities on the blockchain. The service should allow users to create, verify and manage their own identities, as well as to interact with other users and applications that require identity verification. The service should also support features such as identity recovery, revocation, delegation and attestation. The proposal should include the following aspects:

- The design and architecture of the on-chain identity service, including the smart contracts, data structures, protocols and interfaces involved.
- The economic model and incentive mechanism of the on-chain identity service, including the fees, rewards and governance mechanisms for the users, validators and service providers.
- The security analysis and risk assessment of the on-chain identity service, including the potential threats, vulnerabilities and countermeasures.
- The user experience and usability evaluation of the on-chain identity service, including the user interface, user journey and user feedback.



## Challenge: opBNB On-chain Game

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Utilize the low cost and high performance transactions for on-chain games
2. Increase the web3 game playability and attractiveness for gamers

### Challenge Description:

opBNB is a high-performance and low-cost blockchain platform that supports various decentralized applications, including games. opBNB is looking for game developers who can build the next-generation crypto games that can offer abundant playable and valuable in-game assets, user-friendly experience, and good on-chain metrics.

By applying for the opBNB wish list item call for proposal, you will have the opportunity to receive funding, technical support, and marketing assistance from opBNB. You will also join a growing community of game developers and players who are passionate about blockchain gaming.



## Challenge: Decentralized Social Network 

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Innovate on the social network with blockchain technology
2. Protect and tokenize user data and contents
3. Censorship resistance

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for a team of developers who can create a decentralized social network for the BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. The network should be a crypto native platform that supports various social features such as messaging, live streaming, and content sharing. The network should also leverage the power of smart contracts, social assets, and product functions on opBNB to enable new ways of monetization for content creators and users. The network should store its social data on Greenfield, a decentralized storage solution that ensures data sovereignty and privacy. The network should aim to eliminate the need for intermediaries and provide a better value proposition for its participants. 



## Challenge: Perp Dex on opBNB 

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Native Support Perp Dex on opBNB

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for a team of developers who can create a perp dex on opBNB, a decentralized exchange platform that supports perpetual contracts. A perp dex is a type of derivative market that allows traders to speculate on the price movements of various assets without owning them. Perp dexes have several advantages over traditional spot and futures markets, such as lower entry barriers, higher transaction speeds, and more supported assets.

The goal of this project is to build a native perp dex on opBNB that leverages the benefits of the opBNB network, such as high speed and low gas fees. The perp dex should also offer opBNB assets a place to get leveraged exposure and hedge their risks. The perp dex should have the following features:

- Support multiple opBNB assets.

- Provide a user-friendly interface and a robust order book system

- Implement a fair and transparent liquidation mechanism

- Integrate with existing opBNB protocols and services.

- Ensure security and scalability of the perp dex smart contracts

  

## Challenge: Stable Coin Payment for opBNB

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Easy to use stable coin payment system
2. High efficiency payment with low cost, especially for cross-board payment

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for proposals of stable coin payment solutions that leverage the opBNB as the underlying infrastructure. The solutions should aim to provide a seamless, secure and efficient way of using stable coins for various online or offline consumption scenarios, such as e-commerce, gaming, remittance, etc. The solutions should also be easy to use and open to all users, regardless of their location, identity or financial status. The solutions should take advantage of the high performance and low cost of the opBNB, especially for cross-border payment transactions. The solutions should demonstrate how they can integrate with existing stable coin projects/wallets or create new ones that are compatible with the opBNB standards and protocols.
