# Challenges

## Challenge: Decentralized Social Network 

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Innovate on the social network with blockchain technology
2. Protect and tokenize user data and contents
3. Censorship resistance

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for a team of developers who can create a decentralized social network for the BNB Chain ecosystem. The network should be a crypto native platform that supports various social features such as messaging, live streaming, and content sharing. The network should also leverage the power of smart contracts, social assets, and product functions on opBNB to enable new ways of monetization for content creators and users. The network should store its social data on Greenfield, a decentralized storage solution that ensures data sovereignty and privacy. The network should aim to eliminate the need for intermediaries and provide a better value proposition for its participants. 


## Challenge: Creating a Streamlined dApp Development SDK on BNB Chain

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Target web3 newcomers through an intuitive development framework that streamlines the dApp creation process.
2. Establish clear guidelines and promote industry-standard approaches to web3 development within the BNB Chain environment.
3. Seamlessly incorporate a leading AA wallet SDK, increasing accessibility and promoting wider adoption.
4. Eliminate an early cost barrier by providing developers with free access to RPC services.

### Challenge Description:

Decentralized application (dApp) development can be complex, often presenting challenges for new web3 developers. This initiative seeks to revolutionize the process using the BNB Chain ecosystem, with a prioritization of the opBNB Layer 2 solution. 
This SDK offers an opinionated structure to simplify initial development choices, helping developers focus on building core functionality by providing basic dApp templates and common use-case examples to accelerate the development process.


## Challenge: FOC Game Core Stack

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Simplify the creation of FOC games by providing a streamlined SDK that empowers developers to focus on game logic and design.  
2. Deliver a toolkit specifically optimized for the unique requirements of fully on-chain game development.
3. Hide blockchain interactions behind intuitive interfaces, allowing developers to work with familiar concepts and programming languages.

### Challenge Description:
Developing Fully On-Chain (FOC) games inherently presents challenges due to the necessity of all game logic and assets residing directly on the blockchain. This challenge focuses on creating a specialized SDK to streamline FOC development on the BNB Chain.
This solution should offer:

* **Autonomous World Framework:** Enable developers to construct dynamic game worlds using an ECS-like architecture for managing game states directly on the blockchain.
* **Transparent Blockchain Integration:** Handle low-level tasks like data indexing and state updates to the blockchain, freeing developers from these technicalities.
* **Familiar Development Environment:** Support common programming languages (Typescript, Golang, C#) and integrate seamlessly with existing game development workflows.
* **Smart Contract Abstraction:** Define and manage smart contracts as integral parts of game entities and behaviors. 


## Challenge: Seamless Web2 to Web3 Game Evolution

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Provide tools and resources that allow Web2 developers to seamlessly integrate Web3 features into their existing game architectures.
2. Facilitate the development of visually stunning, engaging games (AAA standard) that leverage Web3 principles at their core.
3. Make the process of adding Web3 features as intuitive and frictionless as possible for established game developers.

### Challenge Description:

The goal is to bridge the extensive talent pool of Web2 game developers into the Web3 space. This challenge focuses on empowering existing Web2 game development frameworks to smoothly incorporate Web3 capabilities, enabling the creation of high-quality gaming experiences with Web3 elements. You can start from the top Web2 game backend servers like Nakama, Bemable, and Accelbyte.

* **Web3 Wallet Login:**  Replace traditional login systems with wallet-based authentication for decentralized player identification.
* **NFT Profiles:**  Transform in-game profiles into NFTs, providing true digital ownership and potential cross-game compatibility for players.
* **Web3 Identity and Communication:** Utilize decentralized IDs for matchmaking and in-game communication, fostering secure peer-to-peer interaction.
* **Decentralized Data Storage:**  Implement decentralized storage solutions for player data and game assets, ensuring longevity and enhancing immutability.

## Challenge: Reimagining the Future of Decentralized Video

### Main Objectives

1. **Resilient Content Storage and Streaming:** Develop decentralized storage solutions and streaming protocols that ensure smooth video playback, high availability, and resistance to censorship.
2. **Enhanced Social Features:** Design intuitive social elements (commenting, reactions, decentralized discovery) that foster a vibrant community around video content.
3. **Monetization and Rewards:** Establish fair and transparent monetization models for creators, viewers, and platform participants (including potential tokenization and revenue sharing).

### Challenge Description

We seek proposals for groundbreaking decentralized video platforms that challenge centralized models by prioritizing user control, community engagement, and novel content experiences with opBNB and BNBChain.  The ideal platform will:

* **Content Sovereignty:** Safeguard ownership and control of videos for creators, allowing them to determine distribution and access rights.
* **Accessibility and Performance:**  Ensure efficient content delivery, smooth playback, and low-latency streaming, even as the network scales. 
* **Algorithmic Curation vs. Censorship:**  Balance content discovery mechanisms with the protection of user privacy and combatting abuse or spam.
* **Emerging Content Experiences:** Encourage  experimentation with formats like interactive videos, VR integration, or decentralized video editing tools.

The ultimate goal is to create a decentralized video ecosystem that empowers creators, fosters a thriving community, and unlocks a new era of creativity and engagement.
