## Challenge: Data Migration

### Main Objectives/Goals
1. Create a migration app for BNB Greenfield from decentralized storage.
2. Prioritize UX, ease of use, and IDE integration.
3. Ensure flexibility for adding more migration sources.

### Challenge Description
The challenge is to develop a migration application for BNB Greenfield 
that provides a seamless solution for migrating files from various 
decentralized storage solutions like AWS, Filecoin, Arweave, Storj, etc. 
The tool should prioritize user experience (UX) and ease of use, enabling 
users to effortlessly transfer their files to BNB Greenfield. Integration 
with popular integrated development environments (IDEs) such as VSCode, 
Eclipse, Android Studio, Xcode, and IntelliJ IDEA should be a key focus, 
aligning with their design principles.

The migration tool should offer a user-friendly and automatically identify 
the files for migration through an intuitive graphical user interface 
(GUI) or interactive interface, reducing the need for extensive 
configuration files. Users should be able to input essential details, such 
as private keys and file paths, directly through the GUI. It is advisable 
to integrate a wallet solution to eliminate the need for hardcoding 
private keys altogether, enhancing security and user experience.

The tool should be designed to be extendable, allowing for the easy 
addition of more networks as sources for migration. This flexibility 
ensures that the tool can adapt to evolving storage solutions and cater to 
the needs of both web2 and web3 developers. As part of the acceptance 
criteria for the challenge, the application should be deployed to the 
extension marketplace, supporting at least two networks—one centralized 
and one decentralized—to showcase its capabilities in facilitating smooth 
file migration for various development environments.

## Challenge: Mobile App for Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals
1. Develop user-friendly app for BNB Greenfield data management.
2. Emphasize exceptional UX and UI for engaging user journey.
3. Prioritize convenience and ease of data interaction.

### Challenge Description
The challenge is to develop a user-friendly iPhone/Android application 
that enables users to manage their data on BNB Greenfield. The primary 
focus of the application should be on delivering an exceptional user 
experience (UX) and user interface (UI), ensuring that the user journey is 
engaging and intuitive. The application can incorporate gamification 
principles such as badges and rankings to enhance user engagement, etc

The goal of the application is to provide users with a seamless and 
convenient way to interact with their data on BNB Greenfield. It should 
offer features for uploading, organizing, and accessing stored data, with 
an emphasis on user-friendly navigation and visually appealing design. The 
application should prioritize ease of use and aim to make data management 
tasks as effortless as possible for the users.

## Challenge: Leveraging BNB Greenfield for L1 Data Storage

### Main Objectives/Goals
1. Optimize L1 data storage using BNB Greenfield.
2. Reduce latency and enhance data accessibility.
3. Enable efficient retrieval of dormant or dead data.

### Challenge Description
The challenge seeks innovative solutions to optimize L1 data storage using 
BNB Greenfield's decentralized capabilities. L1 chains often carry vast 
amounts of historical data, including dormant or inactive content, leading 
to increased latency.

The challenge aims to reduce this latency and enhance data accessibility 
by migrating historical data to BNB Greenfield. This solution will enable 
faster and smoother data retrieval on the EVM-compatible chain, resulting 
in an improved user experience.

Additionally, the proposed solution should allow for efficient retrieval 
of dormant or dead data whenever required, ensuring valuable information 
remains accessible and not lost over time.
