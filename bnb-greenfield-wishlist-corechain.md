# Challenges

## Challenge: Light-weight storage provider

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Easy to setup and maintain storage provider
2. Decentralization of storage provider implementation

### Challenge Description:

Greenfield aims to allow users and storage provider maintainers to use a light-weighted storage provider that offers a new implementation of storage provider for easy management and setup. By using the light-weight storage provider, Greenfield allows users to create, configure, and manage storage resources with minimal overhead and complexity.

Considerations:

1. Greenfield is designed to be scalable, reliable, and secure, while also providing high performance and low latency.
2. Greenfield is ideal for applications that need fast and flexible storage solutions, such as web hosting, data analytics, media streaming, and more.


## Challenge: Middleware Service for Dynamic NFT Image Content Updates

### Main Objectives/Goals:

**Develop a middleware service that efficiently manages and updates the visual representation of NFTs stored on BNB Greenfield.** This service will bridge the gap between on-chain NFT data and dynamic off-chain image resources.

### Challenge Description:
In blockchain games, enhancing player engagement often hinges on visually representing in-game progression. This challenge focuses on creating a middleware solution to seamlessly update NFT image content as characters or assets evolve, such as a hero leveling up.

**Key Requirements**

1. Store and organize image assets associated with different levels or states of in-game NFTs.
2. Provide an interface for authorized admins to trigger image updates, ensuring control and oversight of the process.
3. Integrate with game logic to detect changes in NFT attributes (e.g., level-ups) and automatically initiate image updates through the middleware.
4. Offer a developer-friendly SDK for easy integration of the middleware with the BNB Greenfield storage solution.
