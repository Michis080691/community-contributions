## Challenge: Empowering opBNB with Advanced Analytics Support

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. Revolutionize L2 analytics.
2. Create an intuitive analytics dashboard for L2 insights.
3. Build open-source block explorer and real-time status dashboards.

### Challenge Description:
The challenge seeks to revolutionize opBNB by providing comprehensive 
analytics support, enabling users to gain valuable data insights and 
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their L2 activities. The 
primary goal is to develop a powerful analytics ecosystem that encompasses 
various essential elements.

The first objective is to design and implement an analytics dashboard that 
offers users access to useful data insights. This dashboard will serve as 
a centralized hub for users to explore and visualize different L2 aspects, 
such as gas costs, security metrics, and potential savings over a longer 
timeframe. The focus is on creating an intuitive and user-friendly 
interface that empowers users to make informed decisions based on 
real-time data.

The second aspect of the challenge involves building an open-source block 
explorer that supports all rollups. This explorer should offer users the 
ability to delve deep into the data, providing them with a comprehensive 
view of their L2 transactions and activities. This feature will promote 
transparency and encourage in-depth research and analysis, leading to 
novel insights and discoveries.

Moreover, the challenge aims to develop status dashboards that 
continuously monitor the health of the opBNB network. These dashboards 
will provide real-time updates on network performance, identifying 
potential issues and areas for improvement. By offering network health 
monitoring tools, users can proactively address challenges and ensure the 
smooth operation of their L2 activities.
