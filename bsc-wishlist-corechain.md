# Challenges

## Challenge: BNB Smart Chain Consensus Enhancement to encourage fair plan of validators and stabilization of blocks

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Stabilization of blocks
2. Increase the fairness of validator play

### Challenge Description:

Delayed block production may cause more chain reorganization, which reduces the security and efficiency of the network. Moreover, some validators may have an unfair advantage over others due to network latency or malicious behavior. A new consensus enhancement should be introduced to prevent late block production and encourage stabilization of the blocks, as well as to ensure fairness of validators.

Some possible solutions: 

- Implementing a penalty mechanism for late block production, such as reducing the rewards or increasing the slashing risk for validators who produce blocks after a certain deadline.
- Introducing a reward mechanism for early block production, such as increasing the rewards or decreasing the slashing risk for validators who produce blocks before a certain deadline.
- Using a random beacon or a verifiable delay function to select the block proposer for each round, to prevent any validator from having a predictable advantage over others.
- Adopting a Byzantine fault tolerant or a leaderless consensus algorithm, such as Tendermint or HotStuff, to achieve finality and consistency of the blocks with minimal communication overhead and latency.



## Challenge: BNB Chain governance enhancement

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. Improve the fairness and transparency of the BNB Chain governance
2. Improve community engagement

### Challenge Description:
One of the main challenges of decentralized platforms is to design a governance framework that ensures fair and effective decision-making by the community. The current voting methodology, based on delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS), has some limitations, such as low voter turnout, centralization of power, and lack of incentives for participation. Therefore, we propose a new voting methodology that aims to address these issues and encourage more community governance involvement and democracy.

The new voting methodology may consists of the following features:

- Quadratic voting: Each voter can cast multiple votes on a proposal, but the cost of each vote increases quadratically. This allows voters to express their preferences more accurately and prevents the domination of large stakeholders.
- Liquid democracy: Each voter can delegate their votes to another voter, who can further delegate them to others. This creates a network of trust and representation, where voters can choose their own representatives or vote directly on proposals.
- Staking rewards: Each voter who participates in the voting process receives a portion of the staking rewards, proportional to their stake and the number of votes they cast. This creates an incentive for voters to stay informed and engaged in the governance process.

We believe that this new voting methodology will improve the community engagement and the quality of the governance outcomes. We call for proposals and solutions that can further enhance the governance framework and align it with the vision and values of the platform.



## Challenge: Accelerating Blockchain Node Synchronization

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Accelerate blockchain node synchronization.
2. Reduce resources and energy consumption.
3. Prioritize data integrity and security.

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for a talented and innovative developer or team to design and implement a method or algorithm that can significantly speed up the synchronization process for new nodes joining the BSC network. The solution should enhance the decentralization and reliability of the network, as well as be compatible with the existing BSC protocol and infrastructure. The proposal should include the following information:

- A clear and detailed description of the method or algorithm, including its advantages, limitations, and assumptions.
- A technical analysis of the expected performance, scalability, security, and feasibility of the solution, as well as its impact on the network bandwidth, latency, and resource consumption.
- A roadmap and timeline for the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of the solution, as well as a budget estimate and a breakdown of the costs.
- A demonstration or proof-of-concept of the solution, preferably on a testnet or a simulated environment, showing its functionality and effectiveness.
- A list of references and previous works related to the topic, as well as any relevant credentials or qualifications.



## Challenge: Long Term Archive Service Support

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. An incentive mechanism design for archive node maintainers  
2. A well defined data pruning solution.

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for a proposal to design a solution for the BSC network that can provide long term archive service support for opBNB and other applications. The solution should have the following objectives:

- To maintain the archive node of opBNB and ensure its data availability and integrity over time.
- To improve the data availability of the BSC network by increasing the number of archive nodes and reducing the reliance on centralized providers.
- To enhance the node decentralization of the BSC network by incentivize more node providers to join and contribute to the network.
- To improve the incentives for node providers by rewarding them for their service quality, availability, and performance.

The proposal should include a detailed description of the solution architecture, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The proposal should also provide a realistic budget and timeline for the project, as well as a risk analysis and mitigation plan. The proposal should demonstrate how the solution can meet the objectives and benefit the BSC network and its users.





## Challenge: Fair MEV Infrastructure Enhancement

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Build a fair MEV infrastructure that is public to all users and developers.
2. Enhance the fairness of the BSC ecosystem.
3. A public MEV interface standard on BSC.

### Challenge Description:

One of the challenges of implementing MEV (Miner Extractable Value) on BSC (BNB Smart Chain) is to establish a public interface standard that can be adopted by the ecosystem stakeholders, such as validators, relayers, arbitrageurs, and users. A public MEV interface standard would enable a transparent and fair way of capturing the value from transactions on BSC, while minimizing the negative externalities such as network congestion, front-running, and unfair competition. 

We wish to see proposals for a fair MEV infrastructure that can address the following aspects:

- How to define and measure the value extracted by validators and other actors from transactions on BSC
- How to design and implement a public MEV interface standard that can be easily integrated with existing BSC protocols and applications
- How to ensure that the MEV interface standard is compatible with the security, scalability, and decentralization of BSC
- How to incentivize and reward the participation of validators, relayers, arbitrageurs, and users in the MEV ecosystem
- How to mitigate the potential risks and challenges of introducing MEV on BSC, such as ethical, legal, and regulatory issues



## Challenge: Alternative clients for BNB Smart Chain

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Client decentralization.
2. High performance client of BSC for community to maintain.
3. Multiprogramming language friendly.

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for blockchain developers who are interested in developing and maintaining alternative BSC clients. BSC is a fast and scalable blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. However, BSC currently relies on few implementations of its protocol, which poses a risk to its security and resilience. We believe that having multiple implementations of the BSC protocol will increase the decentralization and diversity of the BSC network, and foster innovation and collaboration among the BSC community.

Key considerations:

1. It is a high performance client implementation that can support the big block size of BSC.

2. Fast synchronization with the BSC network.





## Challenge: Privacy Protection Transactions Protect

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. BSC Protocol compatible solution.
2. BSC built-in privacy protection enhancement.

### Challenge Description:

One of the challenges that many organizations face when adopting blockchain technology is the lack of privacy protection for their transactions. While blockchain offers transparency and immutability, it also exposes sensitive data to unauthorized parties. This can pose a serious risk for businesses that deal with confidential information, such as financial records, personal data, or trade secrets. Therefore, we wish to have a built-in capability to support the privacy transactions for organizations who are concerned by the transaction privacy. 

We are looking for proposals of a solution that can enable secure and private transactions on the blockchain, without compromising the benefits of decentralization and trustlessness. The solution should be scalable, efficient, and compatible with existing standards and protocols of BSC. The solution should also be easy to integrate and use by the end-users, and provide them with a clear and intuitive interface to manage their privacy preferences and policies.



## Challenge: Stateless on BSC

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Define the solution of BSC stateless to overcome the middle term storage grow pressure. 
2. Reduce resources and energy consumption.
3. Prioritize data integrity and security.

### Challenge Description:

The problem of stateless BSC is how to reduce the storage requirements of BSC full nodes, which are growing rapidly due to the increasing number of transactions and smart contracts on the network. If the storage growth is not controlled, it will become a bottleneck for the scalability and security of BSC, and also increase the cost and difficulty of running a full node. The solution of stateless BSC is to use a technique called state witnesses, which are proofs that verify the existence and validity of a state element (such as an account or a contract) without requiring the full node to store the entire state. State witnesses are generated by miners and attached to blocks, and can be verified by any node using a cryptographic hash function. By using state witnesses, full nodes only need to store the block headers and the state witnesses, and can reconstruct the state on demand. This way, the storage requirements of full nodes are greatly reduced, and the network can handle more transactions and smart contracts without compromising security or decentralization. The solution of stateless BSC should be compatible with Ethereum, which is also working on a similar technique for its future upgrade. This means that the format and structure of state witnesses should follow the Ethereum specifications, and that BSC should be able to interoperate with Ethereum on stateless transactions and contracts. A wishlist item that asks for a proposal of a solution of stateless BSC is:

- The solution should allow full nodes to verify state witnesses using a cryptographic hash function, and reconstruct the state on demand.
- The solution should follow the Ethereum specifications for state witnesses, and interoperate with Ethereum on stateless transactions and contracts.
- The solution should be tested and benchmarked on various scenarios and metrics, such as storage size, verification time, bandwidth usage, etc.
