# Challenges



## Challenge: BNB Chain governance enhancement

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. Improve the fairness and transparency of the BNB Chain governance
2. Improve community engagement

### Priority 

High, Medium, Low

### Challenge Description:
One of the main challenges of decentralized platforms is to design a governance framework that ensures fair and effective decision-making by the community. The current voting methodology, based on delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS), has some limitations, such as low voter turnout, centralization of power, and lack of incentives for participation. Therefore, we propose a new voting methodology that aims to address these issues and encourage more community governance involvement and democracy.

The new voting methodology may consists of the following features:

- Quadratic voting: Each voter can cast multiple votes on a proposal, but the cost of each vote increases quadratically. This allows voters to express their preferences more accurately and prevents the domination of large stakeholders.
- Liquid democracy: Each voter can delegate their votes to another voter, who can further delegate them to others. This creates a network of trust and representation, where voters can choose their own representatives or vote directly on proposals.
- Staking rewards: Each voter who participates in the voting process receives a portion of the staking rewards, proportional to their stake and the number of votes they cast. This creates an incentive for voters to stay informed and engaged in the governance process.

We believe that this new voting methodology will improve the community engagement and the quality of the governance outcomes. We call for proposals and solutions that can further enhance the governance framework and align it with the vision and values of the platform.



## Challenge: Alternative clients for BNB Smart Chain

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Client decentralization.
2. High performance client of BSC for community to maintain.
3. Multiprogramming language friendly.

### Challenge Description:

We are looking for blockchain developers who are interested in developing and maintaining alternative BSC clients. BSC is a fast and scalable blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. However, BSC currently relies on few implementations of its protocol, which poses a risk to its security and resilience. We believe that having multiple implementations of the BSC protocol will increase the decentralization and diversity of the BSC network, and foster innovation and collaboration among the BSC community.

Key considerations:

1. It is a high performance client implementation that can support the big block size of BSC.

2. Fast synchronization with the BSC network.
