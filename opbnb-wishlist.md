# Challenges

## Challenge: Bridging L2 Networks for Seamless Cross-Chain Activity

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. Develop bridges for direct L2 network connections.
2. Enable frictionless cross-chain activity for users.
3. Enhance user experience and L2 network adoption.

### Challenge Description:
The challenge focuses on creating innovative solutions to address the 
growing problem of siloed assets on Layer 2 (L2) networks of Ethereum and 
BNB Chain. The challenge calls for the development of bridges directly 
connecting L2s of Ethereum with L2s of BNB Chain, as well as bridging 
between L2s of BNB Chain itself. These bridges will ensure a frictionless 
cross-chain activity experience for users.

Currently, as more L2s emerge on both Ethereum and BNB Chain, assets 
become isolated within these networks. Users encounter delays and 
complications when attempting to withdraw funds or transfer assets between 
networks. The lack of direct bridging hampers the full potential of L2 
networks, hindering a smooth user experience.

The proposed solution should enable users to seamlessly conduct 
cross-chain activities without the need for extended waiting periods or 
bringing assets back to the Mainnet to transfer them to another network. 
The bridges will act as essential links, allowing users to interact with 
different L2 networks effortlessly.

By creating these bridges, the challenge aims to foster a better user 
experience, empowering users to become L2 citizens. The bridges will break 
down barriers and enable efficient asset movement between L2 networks, 
enhancing the overall usability and adoption of L2 solutions.
## Challenge: opBNB Data Availability Layer on Greenfield

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. Create a data availability layer for opBNB rollup chain.
2. Enhance scalability and security for opBNB.
3. Utilize BNB Greenfield's decentralized storage for data integrity.

### Challenge Description:
The challenge presented is to create a data availability layer for L2 
rollup chains, addressing the need for secure and accessible data to 
verify block validity and enable user interaction. The existing scaling 
strategies such as optimistic rollups require data availability to ensure 
the integrity of transactions and user balances. The fraud proofs are used 
to detect invalid transactions, but users still need assurance that all 
block data has been published. BSC serves as the data availability layer 
for optimistic rollups by posting all rollup blocks onto its chain.

To address this challenge, the proposal suggests building a data 
availability layer that utilizes BNB Greenfield's decentralized storage 
capabilities. This layer would securely store opBNB rollup blocks and 
provide easy access to users, ensuring they can validate block integrity 
and efficiently interact with the opBNB rollup chain.

The main goal of the challenge is to enhance the scalability and security 
of opBNB rollup chain by creating a reliable data availability solution. 
BNB Greenfield would serve as the ideal platform for this layer, as its 
decentralized storage ensures data accessibility and cost-effectiveness. 
By successfully implementing this solution, opBNB would operate with 
increased security and efficiency, reducing the risks of fraud and 
providing users with confidence in the validity of transactions and their 
balances.

Key considerations for the proposed solution include seamless integration 
with opBNB, enabling automated and secure data transfer to BNB Greenfield. 
Additionally, addressing the incentive for block producers to publish data 
promptly is crucial to ensuring timely and reliable data availability. 
Overall, the successful implementation of the data availability layer will 
significantly improve the performance and adoption of opBNB, benefiting 
the entire blockchain ecosystem.
## Challenge: Empowering opBNB with Advanced Analytics Support

### Main Objectives/Goals:
1. Revolutionize L2 analytics.
2. Create an intuitive analytics dashboard for L2 insights.
3. Build open-source block explorer and real-time status dashboards.

### Challenge Description:
The challenge seeks to revolutionize opBNB by providing comprehensive 
analytics support, enabling users to gain valuable data insights and 
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their L2 activities. The 
primary goal is to develop a powerful analytics ecosystem that encompasses 
various essential elements.

The first objective is to design and implement an analytics dashboard that 
offers users access to useful data insights. This dashboard will serve as 
a centralized hub for users to explore and visualize different L2 aspects, 
such as gas costs, security metrics, and potential savings over a longer 
timeframe. The focus is on creating an intuitive and user-friendly 
interface that empowers users to make informed decisions based on 
real-time data.

The second aspect of the challenge involves building an open-source block 
explorer that supports all rollups. This explorer should offer users the 
ability to delve deep into the data, providing them with a comprehensive 
view of their L2 transactions and activities. This feature will promote 
transparency and encourage in-depth research and analysis, leading to 
novel insights and discoveries.

Moreover, the challenge aims to develop status dashboards that 
continuously monitor the health of the opBNB network. These dashboards 
will provide real-time updates on network performance, identifying 
potential issues and areas for improvement. By offering network health 
monitoring tools, users can proactively address challenges and ensure the 
smooth operation of their L2 activities.

## Challenge: Account abstraction layer for opBNB

### Main Objectives/Goals:

1. Implement efficient and secure account abstraction in smart contract 
wallets.
2. Prioritize efficiency, security, and backward compatibility.
3. Streamline authorization for improved security and user experience.

### Challenge Description:
The introduction of account abstraction in the EVM ecosystem has created 
momentum for defining authorization policies in smart contract wallets. 
However, this split of validation and execution steps in the bundling 
process poses potential issues for bundlers operating on L2 transactions 
both for opBNB and other potential L2s wishing to extend to BSC. The delay 
between simulated transaction validation and final inclusion by sequencers 
introduces a risk of reverted bundle submissions, leading to lost value 
for bundlers. 

The challenge is to develop an account abstraction layer for opBNB and BSC 
that efficiently handles authorization policies for actions on behalf of 
an account. The solution should be secure and backwards compatible with 
the Ethereum community to ensure smooth adoption. 

The proposed solution should prioritize efficiency and security while 
complying with the EIP-4337 requirements. Backward compatibility is 
essential to facilitate seamless integration and adoption by the broader 
types of L2s. Successful implementation will enable users to define 
authorization policies within smart contract wallets efficiently and 
securely, fostering innovation and improved user experiences in the BNB 
ecosystem. The account abstraction layer will streamline authorization for 
actions on behalf of accounts, promoting enhanced security and 
accessibility for users.
